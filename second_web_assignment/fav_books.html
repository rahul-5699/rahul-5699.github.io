    <h2>4. Operating System Concepts Paperback – January 1, 2012</h2>
    <img src="os.jpg">
    <p>
      Operating System Concepts, Windows Xp Update starts with chapters on computer system structures and operating system structures to enlighten readers regarding the key areas involved in successfully running both the computer and its software.
      The book deals with the underlying concepts that define an operating system, such as process management, file systems, storage access, resource protection, and memory management. It also describes in detail two operating systems from Microsoft, Windows XP and Windows 2000.
      Under the concept of process management, processes and threads have been discussed in detail by the author. A process may be defined as an instance of any computer programme during its execution. Processes consist of a variety of resources like memory and certain security attributes. A thread is a part of the process, and is independently managed by the operating system scheduler.
      The file systems and storage access features like file system interface and implementation, mass-storage structure, and distributed file systems have been covered extensively by the authors in the book.
      Under the resource protection and memory management concepts, the book covers important topics like virtual memory and memory protection.
      Along with Windows XP and 2000, the authors have also included a separate section on the operating system Linux, which is also used widely around the world by computer users.
      The authors have taken great care to present the contents of Operating System Concepts, Windows Xp Update in an easy-to-understand manner.

    <h2>5. Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach Paperback – 30 Jun 2017 - Computer Networking  (English, Paperback, Keith W. Ross, James F. kurose)</h2>
    <img src="network.jpg">
    <p>
      Building on the successful top-down approach of previous editions, the Sixth Edition of Computer Networking continues with 
      an early emphasis on application-layer paradigms and application programming interfaces (the top layer), encouraging a hands-on
      experience with protocols and networking concepts, before working down the protocol stack to more abstract layers. This book
      has become the dominant book for this course because of the authors’ reputations, the precision of explanation, the quality 
      of the art program and the value of their own supplements. Features A balanced presentation focuses on the Internet as a 
      specific motivating example of a network and also introduces students to protocols in a more theoretical context. A chapter
      on wireless and mobility includes insight into 802.11 and coverage of ad hoc networking. Principles and Practice boxes 
      throughout demonstrate real-world applications of the principles studied. Case History boxes are sprinkled in to help tell
      the story of the history and development of computer networking. Material on application programming development is included,
      along with numerous programming assignments. A highly developed art program enhances the descriptions of concepts. A comprehensive 
      Companion Website, which includes additional learning material, links to relevant online resources and lab material Table of 
      Contents Chapter 1 Computer Networks and the Internet Chapter 2 Application Layer Chapter 3 Transport Layer Chapter 4 The 
      Network Layer Chapter 5 The Link Layer: Links, Access Networks and LANs Chapter 6 Wireless and Mobile Networks Chapter 7
      Multimedia Networking Applications Chapter 8 Security in Computer Networks Chapter 9 Network Management
